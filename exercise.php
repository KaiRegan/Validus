      <h1>Recommended cool Routine </h1>

</div>
    <div class="col-12">
      <h1 class="lead">This is the routine that should cater for everyone regardless of their level. The main limitation of this workout is the time it takes per session, there is plenty of information on the specifics of this workout on the "recommended routine" page. However the basic idea is that it consists of resistance bodyweight exercises which can be done at different levels. The workout should take no more than 1 hour and 10  minutes to complete. The workout has been created by a number of bodyweight experts and can be found for free on reddit. Validus has provided the routine in a clear layout style to make it easy to follow. The instructions bellow WILL be confusing at first. Make sure to visit the <a href="recommended.php">recommended routine page</a> to see a breakdown of the workout.</h1>

            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <p> There are nine exercises. These exercises are to be done in pairs and one triplet
              to save time. Pairing two exercises means doing a set of the first exercise, resting 90 seconds,
              then doing a set of the second exercise, resting 90 seconds, and repeating until you've done 3
              sets of that pair. For the triplet, you do a set of the first exercise, rest 60 seconds, do a set of the
              second exercise, rest 60 seconds, do a set of the third exercise, rest 60 seconds, and repeating
              until you've done 3 sets of that triplet.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Rest Time</h1>
            <p>If 90 seconds is not enough, you can rest up to 3 minutes if you like.</p>
<hr>
            <h1>Reps</h1>
            <p>​Overall, if your pull-up max is say 8 reps, then go for one rep short of failure, such as
              7-7-7 instead of 8-6-5. The key is to not work to failure for the first set or two because it
              significantly detracts from performance in later sets which reduces your ability to perform good
              reps and maximize volume to get stronger and bigger muscles. The 90 second pairing is so that
              there is minimum 3 minutes rest between each set, which is 3 minutes total. This rest time is
              where there is 99% replenishment of ATP in the muscles, so you are not limited by fatigue in the
              muscles. Sticking with failure-1 repetitions and 3 total minutes between sets of the same
              exercise allows you to maximize volume and effort level which is essential for strength and
              hypertrophy.</p>
<hr>
            <h1>Order</h1>
            <p>You can switch the order of the exercises, as long as you leave the warm-up in the warm-up, and the strength work in the strength work.</p>
<hr>
              <h1>Frequency</h1>
              <p>​This routine is written for 3x a week workouts, with at least one rest day in between
              workouts. For example you could do Mon/Weds/Fri, or Tues/Thurs/Sun, whatever works for your
              schedule. Don’t train every day - it does not make you more effective. Don't purposely split the
              workout into separate days. It's meant to be a full body workout.</p>
              <h1>Skill work</h1>
              <p> Want to go upside down? The skill work from the former RR has been moved to a
              ‘Skill Day’ routine, which can be slotted into this routine (before starting the strength work
              section) or practised on rest days.</p>

                <p>Like with most things time is important, we are not trying to over promise and under deliver. This workout does work at a gradual pace, you should expect to notice physical changes after 4 weeks although you will likely find the workouts become easier after 2.</p>

      <h2>The Minimalist Routine</h2>
      <p>The recommended routine may seem too intimidating, so we recommend the minimalist routine instead. </p>
      <p>A quick and simple, 'bare minimum', balanced exercise routine for people who just want to move more and get the benefits of regular exercise.
      <P>You can do this routine every day but if your goals include strength and muscle growth three times per week with gradual progression to harder exercises is better. Consider mobility & flexibility training and/or low-intensity cardio if you'd like to do something on the days you're not doing this routine.</p>
